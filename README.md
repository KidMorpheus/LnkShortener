LnkShortener is an Android app for shortening URLs. It uses [Polr](https://github.com/Cydrobolt/polr), an open-source URL shortener.

## Version 2
This is the developement branch for a completely new version 2. LnkShortener was my first android project, looking back it was fun, but the code is inefficient and ugly. Hence the decision for a fresh start. Since this still is more of a hobby project there is no release date for V2.
